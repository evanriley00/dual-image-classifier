DUAL IMAGE CLASSIFIER – FASHION MNIST WEB APP

This project is a complete machine learning pipeline and web app that classifies fashion items from black-and-white 28x28 pixel images using TensorFlow and Flask.

---

WHAT IT DOES

- Trains a deep learning model on the Fashion MNIST dataset
- Launches a simple web interface for uploading and predicting fashion images
- Displays the predicted label (e.g., "Sneaker", "T-Shirt", "Bag")

---

HOW TO RUN IT LOCALLY

1. Install Python dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the app:

   python app.py

Then visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser.
